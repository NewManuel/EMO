# Title: EMO -  Music Application

## Description
---

Imagine you're feeling upset about something and want to uplift your spirit, EMO is the app that can do that. You open the application, choose what emotion you currently feel and how you want to feel from a list of emojis, and then the application chooses a genre, artist and song tailored to your profile preference, and "voila!" you're on to a better, more cheerful day.

## User Story
---

As a music listener who might be in a less than ideal mood, I want an app that will provide me with music that is tailored specifically to me, which is determined by a series of user-specific questions aimed at deciphering my current mood along with deciphering the mood I intend to feel after the experince so that I can use the app to actively alter my mood.

## Acceptance Criteria
